Demonstration of using some of [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles.<br>
The following scenarios can be imagined.<br>
1. The application was written using [hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) to access the database, but one of the customers requested to use [eclipselink](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/) for this.
2. Or the application is written using "RESOURCE_LOCAL" transactions, but one of the customers requested to use a transaction manager.
3. etc...

This project uses SOLID principles to extend the project while keeping it [maintainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance).
